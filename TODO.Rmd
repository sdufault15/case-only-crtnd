#### Active Tasks
* Determine when the estimated Var(logOR) is negative
* Tidy up results of simulations - what are the informative plots that we want??


#### Complete Tasks
* One function for estimating either lambda or gamma: `lambda-gamma-function.R`

#### General Thoughts
* It's seems obvious now that $\widehat{\lambda}_{RR} = \lambda_{RR}\times\lambda_{HCSB}$

#### General Organization
* It seems that `test-positive-perm-example`, `test-positive-only`, and `test-positive-fraction-v-test-positive` are all out of date. Should be able to remove them from the folder, given the manuscript is most up-to-date.
* Can remove casesOnlyFunction.R as it is now equivalent to lambda-gamma-function.R and less clean
