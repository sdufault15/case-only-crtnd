#### Active Tasks

#### Complete Tasks
* One function for estimating either lambda or gamma: `lambda-gamma-function.R`

#### General Thoughts
*

#### General Organization
* It seems that `test-positive-perm-example`, `test-positive-only`, and `test-positive-fraction-v-test-positive` are all out of date. Should be able to remove them from the folder, given the manuscript is most up-to-date.
* Can remove casesOnlyFunction.R as it is now equivalent to lambda-gamma-function.R and less clean
