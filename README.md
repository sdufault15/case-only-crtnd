# Analysis of  Cluster Randomized Test-Negative Designs: A Case-Only Approach

## Objective of this Repository
This repository holds all of the code necessary to recreate the analysis performed in the paper by the same name. The code has not been optimized, but should accurately return the results described in the paper. 

## Organization of this Repository
This repository is organized in the following fashion:
* **lib** contains user-written functions
* **docs** contains any finalized pdf reports produced with the code from lib
* **reports** contains the .Rmd files used to generate the reports contained in docs
* **sandbox** contains code that is in progress or code that is used to generate the reports/docs
* **analysis** contains the R scripts that were run either locally or on the cluster to generate the results used in the reports/docs
